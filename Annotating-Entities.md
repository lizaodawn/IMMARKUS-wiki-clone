To annotate something as an entity:

1. Select it in the image with the drawing tools.
2. Click the __Add Tag__ button in the right sidebar. This will open the data model search dialog.

## Data Model Search Dialog

The dialog provides full-text search over all Enitity Classes in your data model. If you don't enter a search
query into the search field, the dialog will show the root classes in your model instead.

In the screenshot above, the data model has a single root class called __Main Object__. Clicking __Main Class__ will navigate down the hierarchy, and show three child classes - __Bridge__, __Wall__ and __Gate__.

You will also notice that __Main Object__ has now been picked as your current selection. You can click the __Ok__ button at the bottom of the dialog to tag your entity as a __Main Object__, or you can navigate the data model hierarchy further.

Click any of the child classes listed below __Main Object__. E.g. in the screenshot above, clicking __Wall__ will tag the annotation as a __Wall__ entity. The annotation will adopt the Wall type's color coding and show it's properties form in the sidebar.
