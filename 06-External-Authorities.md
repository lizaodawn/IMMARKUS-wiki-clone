Using the External Authority property type allows you to associate an entity class with one or more external authority services. You can add multiple authorities per field, and multiple fields per entity class. 
In the property editor, type a name for your property ("place ID" in **figure 21**) and select the External Authority field type.

As you fill in properties for the annotated entity, the external authority popup displays a search field and the authority service result page below it.  Click the â†— icon on the right side of the search field to open the current authority search in a new browser tab. The links to external authorities need to be copy-and-pasted in the relevant field of the schema.
