# **What is IMMARKUS?**

IMMARKUS is a semantic image annotation tool that allows you to construct custom ontologies, make selections on images, identify specific image regions using ontological concepts, and establish links between elements within your images.  

# **Where does IMMARKUS save files?**

IMMARKUS operates fully locally without transmitting data to a server. This means all images, data models and annotations are stored on your computer.  

!!This means your image files will be directly edited by IMMARKUS. We recommend you work with copies on IMMARKUS and save original files in a different folder to avoid the loss of original files.
