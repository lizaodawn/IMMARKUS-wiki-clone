IMMARKUS is a semantic image annotation tool that allows you to construct custom ontologies, make selections on images, identify specific image regions using ontological concepts, and establish links between elements within your images.

Setting up IMMARKUS is straightforward and hassle-free. Open it in your browser, select a folder on your computer, and begin annotating. 

Importantly, IMMARKUS operates fully locally. No data is ever transmitted to a server â€“ everything, from images to your data model and annotations, remains securely stored on your computer, ensuring complete privacy and control over your work.
