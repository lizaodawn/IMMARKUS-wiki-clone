1. To start working with IMMARKUS, create or locate a folder with jpeg or png files on your computer. 

NOTE: Your image files will be directly edited by IMMARKUS. We recommend that you work with copies of your files and save the original files in another folder to avoid the loss of originals. 

2. Go to IMMARKUS [immarkus.xmarkus.org](https://immarkus.xmarkus.org/)

3. Click **Open New Folder** and select the folder containing the images you want to annotate.

 If you have already used IMMARKUS, the folder with which you last worked will be displayed next to **Open New Folder** (in Figure 5 above, the folder "workshop cases") 

4. You will see a popup window asking "Let site edit files?" Click **Edit files** to allow IMMARKUS to edit the files in the selected folder.
