After [uploading the image folder](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/t_02-Getting-Started), the IMMARKUS interface appears. The following options are available in the left menu bar:

1.	**Images** is where all the subfolders are stored. Clicking on an image opens the annotation mode.
2.	**Data model** is where you can create or edit [data model](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/03-Designing-Data-Model) for annotating images. You can also input the metadata.
3.	**Knowledge graph** is a placeholder for now. Here you can access an overview of annotations and their relations in the future.
4.	**Export** is where you can export data in different formats.
5.	**MARKUS** is also a placeholder currently.
