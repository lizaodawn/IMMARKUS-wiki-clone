After [uploading an image folder](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/01-Uploading-Images), the IMMARKUS interface appears. The following options are available in the left menu bar:

1.	**Images** is where all the subfolders are stored. Clicking on an image opens the [annotation mode](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/04-Annotating-Images).
2.	**Data Model** is where you can create or edit a [data model](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/03-Designing-a-Data-Model) for annotating images. You can also define a schema for [metadata](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/05-Working-with-Metadata).
3.	**Knowledge Graph** is a placeholder for now. This is where you will be able to access an overview of your annotations and their relations in the future.
4.	**Export** is where you can export data in different formats.
5.	**MARKUS** is a placeholder currently. Here you will be able to link and export to other modules in the X-MARKUS platform.
6. **About** is where you can find information on funding for the project and how to cite us.
7. **Help** will lead you back to this wiki page.
