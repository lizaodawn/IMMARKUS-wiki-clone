2.	Zoom in or zoom out of an image
3.	Move through the images in the same subfolder
4.	Undo/redo 
5.	Move between annotations
6.	[Draw a shape](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/04-Annotating-Image#draw-annotations) (select rectangle, polygon, or ellipse)

# Drawing Annotations

Decide which part of the image you would like to tag and draw a shape.

Click the draw button (#6 in **Figure 3** and **4**) and select one of the three options for drawing shapes (rectangle, polygon, or ellipse).

Then click and drag on the part of the image that you want to annotate. Be sure to click the part of the image you want to annotate before you move the pointer over the image to avoid moving the image.

**Tip:** Double-clicking will end the drawing; this is especially useful when drawing a polygon.
	 
# Annotating Multiple Images Simultaneously

You can annotate images side by side by clicking **Add Image** (#1 in **Figures 3** and **4**). You can drag and drop windows to move them around and change their layout.

# Using External Authorities in Annotations

Using the External Authority property type allows you to associate an entity class with one or more external authority services. You can add multiple authorities per field, and multiple fields per entity class. 

In the property editor, type a name for your property ("place ID" in **Figure 21**) and select the External Authority field type.

**Figure 21.** Available Options for External Authorities

As you fill in properties for the annotated entity, the external authority popup displays a search field and the authority service result page below it.  

Click the â†— icon on the right side of the search field to open the current authority search in a new browser tab. 

To add an id paste the relevant information from the external authority in the corresponding field of the schema.
