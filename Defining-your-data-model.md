Before you start working with IMMARKUS, you have to define a data model. The data model has three parts:

- The __Image Metadata__ schema, which defines how you describe the __image files__ in your collection.
- The __Folder Metadata__ schema, which defines how you record information about the __directory folders__ in your collection. This can be useful in case your folders represent sub-collections.
- Most importantly: the __Entity Class model__, which defines the classes you will use to identify Entities in you image annotations.

## Entity Classes

Click the __Create Entity Class__ button to create a new class. This will open the Entity Class editor.

- Choose a unique identifier for the class (mandatory)
- Pick a color (this will be for color-coding image annotations later)

Optionally:
- Choose a user-friendly display name for your class
