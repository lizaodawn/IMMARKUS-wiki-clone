You can export your data model, annotations, and metadata. Click on the **Export** page in the [IMMARKUS Interface](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/03-The-Interface) and select the data you wish to export.

## Exporting Annotations

Click and download **Annotations**.  
 1. **Annotation Data**: export all annotations as a flat list in the [W3C Web Annotation](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) JSON-LD format (JSON for Linked Data, a specification for encoding contextualized meaning into JSON documents).
 2. **Annotations and Images**: generates one XLSX file with multiple worksheets. Each worksheet is for each top-level (parent) entity class. 
Each property is exported as a column followed by the image snippet, the file name, the annotation ID and the time when the annotation was created.

## Exporting a Data Model

In **Data Model**, you can choose what to export: **Entity Classes**, **Image Metadata**, **Folder Metadata**, or the entire IMMARKUS Data Model. All the exports are downloaded as a JSON file.  

Full IMMARKUS Data Model is the same file you will find in your working folder as _immarkus.model.json.
