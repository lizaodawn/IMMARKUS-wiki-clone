## Creating a Hierarchical Data Model: Parent-Child Entity Classes 

 

You can create a hierarchical data model. For the concepts of entities and properties see __t_04_03 (link needed)__

In the data model, we can define common properties that are shared among parent and child entity classes. Child classes inherit properties from parent classes. Also, we can define properties that are specific to child classes.  

You can create a child class in annotation mode and in the Data Model __(see figure 12)__. Click the Create New Entity button and: 

1. Define Entity Class (city_gate) 

1. Define Display Name (City gate) 

1. Choose the Parent Class (in this case the Parent is obj_part)
