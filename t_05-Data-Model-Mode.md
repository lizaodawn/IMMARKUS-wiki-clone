# Creating a Hierarchical Data Model
You can create a hierarchical data model. For the concepts of entities and properties see [Creating Entities and Properties in Annotation Mode](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/t_04-Annotation-Mode#creating-entities-and-properties-in-annotation-mode)
## Parent-Child Entity Classes 

In the data model, we can define common properties that are shared among parent and child entity classes. Child classes inherit properties from parent classes. Also, we can define properties that are specific to child classes.  

You can create a child class in annotation mode and in the Data Model __(see figure 12)__. Click the Create New Entity button and: 

1. Define **Entity Class** (city_gate) 

1. Define **Display Name** (City gate) 

1. Choose the **Parent Class** (in this case the Parent is obj_part.)

## Inherited Properties

In Figure 13, the child class named "city_gate" inherits all the properties from the parent class named "obj_part".  

In the Properties editor, it looks like this entity does not have any properties (circled in red in **figure 13**). This means no specific property has been added to this child class. But as a child class city_gate inherits all the properties from the parent class (circled in blue) as shown on the right sidebar in **figure 13**.

## View Parent-Child Relationship

Classes do not need to have a parent-child relationship. Whether they do depends on your own data design. 

* The entity classes for which you have created child classes have a drop-down menu “>” on the left (red square in **figure 14**). 

* Click the drop-down menu to expand the parent class and you will see child classes belonging to the parent class.  

* The properties belonging to or inherited from the parent to the child class are shown on the row of the parent class.  

* On the row of the child class, you can only see the properties specifically added to the child class. 

* The ones that do not have children have no drop-down menu (blue square in **figure 14**).

# Creating Metadata Schemas
<br/>

In the data model you can also add the metadata. The metadata can be recorded at both the folder (or sub-folder) and the individual image level. 

## Adding Folder Metadata

1. Go to the Folder Metadata tab and click New Folder Schema. 

![Screenshot (498)](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/assets/128056738/2210a06d-eedd-482f-b519-16b28e845113)

2. Properties in metadata are added in the same way as with the entity classes, with the same property options.

3. Add Property Name ("title” below) and choose a Data Type ("text").  

4. After you finish, make sure to click Save Schema.

## Adding Metatdata for Individual Images

The metadata for individual images can be added in the same way as with folder metadata.  

1. Choose New Image Schema and Click Add Metadata Property.

2. Define Property Name and choose data type. Click Save Property.
