Here are some of the highlights of what IMMARKUS offers.

## Multi-Window Zoomable Image Annotation

IMMARKUS provides a zoomable view to support annotating large images, and tools for creating __rectangle__, __polygon__ and __circle/ellipse__ selections. Similar to multi-image viewers like [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/), IMMARKUS provides a multi-window environment for annotating multiple images side by side.

## Design Your Own Ontology

IMMARKUS includes a form-based editor to create and manage your personal data model. The data model is designed around the concepts of **Entity Classes** and **Properties**.

- Use __Entity Classes__ to annotate classes of concepts or things (e.g., a city wall, a bridge, a human figure, an animal, a plant).
- Define __Properties__ for your Entity Classes, to record specific details about entity classes (e.g., name, dimension, location, identifier). 
- Your data model can be __hierarchical__. Each entity class can have a parent class. Properties on the parent class are automatically inherited to the child class. This way, you can define common properties that are shared between parent and child entity classes; and also define properties that are particular to child classes.

## Property Types

IMMARKUS offers a range of data types you can use to capture properties of different entity classes. Think of it as a personal "database builder" for your data model. The following seven data types are currently available:

- Text 
- Number
- Options
- URI
- Geo-coordinates
- Measurement 
- External authority
