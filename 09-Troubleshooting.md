## IIIF Support in IMMARKUS

IMMARKUS supports imports from IIIF Presentation Manifests, allowing you to bring images (whether organized in a folder structure or as individual canvases) and their associated metadata from IIIF-compliant collections directly into your workspace.

You can always export annotations, relationships, and image snippets, to your local storage, keeping full control over your work.

Key advantages working with IIIF:

* **Efficient Image Access and Handling**: Access high-resolution images and metadata remotely, reducing reliance on local storage. You can view scalable images at various zoom levels without downloading large files and manipulate them directly from the source.

* **Integration of Multiple Collections**: IIIF enables users to easily integrate image and metadata sources from different collections as they all follow a shared, interoperable standard.

## Troubleshooting (Updating)

**1. Fatal Fetch**

The following links will not work:
- viewer pages – e.g. pages that embed Mirador or Universal Viewer.
- links to image files – jpg, png, etc.
- IIIF Image API endpoints – ending with info.json.

**2. Import Successful but Invisible Canvas**

**3. Incomplete Metadata?** 

Metadata may be incomplete depending on the institution. You have the flexibility to create and edit your own metadata schema and save them as IMMARKUS exports.
