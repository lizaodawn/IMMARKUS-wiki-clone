The **Knowledge Graph** (**Figure 1**) organizes data from all sources (folders and images) and allows you to view these sources, as well as all data and metadata annotations, to explore connections between them, and to navigate to the desired content.   

# Default View 

The default view shows all images (blue nodes) and entity classes (green nodes). To add sub-folders as nodes to the default view see [Show Sub-folders as Nodes](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/07-Exploring-Data-in-Knowledge-Graph#show-sub-folders-as-nodes). You can also make changes to the default view using the buttons at the bottom right of the screen (see [Settings](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/07-Exploring-Data-in-Knowledge-Graph#settings)). 

Use the scroll wheel on your mouse to **zoom** into the knowledge graph. To **pan** the graph across the screen, click on an empty space on the graph and drag your cursor across the screen. You can also **expand** the graph to full screen by clicking on the expand button at the bottom right (circled in blue on **Figure 1**).

# Nodes
You can inspect individual nodes, move them, and pin them on the knowledge graph (**Figure 2**).  Click and drag a node to pin it on the knowledge graph. To unpin a node, click on the pin icon at the bottom of the screen (circled in blue).

## Entity Class Nodes 

To see all annotations of a specific entity class click on an entity class node (in this case _survey_) (**Figure 3**). You can access the individual annotations by clicking on the **Open Image** button. IMMARKUS will then take you to the individual image in the [Image Gallery](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/03-The-Interface). This will return the knowledge graph to default mode.

## Image Nodes 

If you want to see all entity classes annotated on an individual image, click on an image node (**Figure 4**). You can access the image by clicking on the **Open Image** button. IMMARKUS will then take you to the individual image in the [Image Gallery](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/wiki/03-The-Interface). This will return the knowledge graph to default mode.

You can also view and modify image metadata in the knowledge graph: select an image node and click on the **Information** button (in blue).  From here you can also select a predefined schema and fill out image metadata (**Figure 5**).

# Settings 

Settings allow you to change the way the data is displayed. Clicking on the **Settings** icon on the bottom right corner of the knowledge graph will take you to a menu with several options. You can combine selections from those options to adapt the graph to your needs.  

## Hide Labels 

Hide labels hides text labels from the graph. You can view the labels by hovering over nodes (**Figure 6**). 

![KG6](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/assets/128056738/0f8c30d4-8423-47d7-a709-66081d0d697d)

## Show Sub-folders as Nodes  

Show sub-folders as nodes allows you to see the distribution of your images and entities across sub-folders on the graph (crimson nodes on **Figure 7**)

## Hide Unconnected Nodes  

Hide unconnected nodes hides unused entity classes and images without entity annotations (compare the graphs on **Figures 6** and **8**) and makes the graph less cluttered and focused on annotated content.

## Knowledge Graph Search 

In **Graph Search** you can search and filter images in the current project according to metadata and/or properties; you can also export the results of your search.  

Start searching by clicking the magnifying glass icon (circled in blue on **Figure 9**) and selecting either the “search images by (folder and image) metadata” (**_where_**) option or the “search by entity class” (**_annotated with_**) option. 

![KG9](https://github.com/rsimon/immarkus/assets/128056738/91a97468-4f86-4fcc-a2e9-b161fb0b031d)
**Figure 9.** Graph Search

You can continue to filter your results by adding more search conditions (**Figure 10**): 

1. Click **Add Condition** to add a condition to your search. 

2. **Sub-Condition ⊕** is only available for filtering according to a property of an entity class.  

3. Click **Export Search Result** to export the results of your search to an .XLSX file. 

4. Edit your search by either deleting individual conditions or sub-conditions.  

5. Reset the search by pressing the **Clear All button**.
